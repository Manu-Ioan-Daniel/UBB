# Introduction

My name is Daniel and I’ll be taking you through the early evolution of programming languages starting from binary code and assembly and moving to high-level languages like FORTRAN, COBOL, and ALGOL. Let’s go back to the first days of programming when computers like the ENIAC needed instructions in pure binary.

# Chapter 01: Binary Beginnings

- Early programming wasn’t done on screens or keyboards. Programmers flipped switches or wired plugboards to input code. Every instruction was precious because memory and processing power were extremely limited. On the right we have a small machine code example where each binary number represents an instruction for the computer
    
- As computers evolved, programmers needed a way to make code more readable and less error-prone. That’s where assembly mnemonics come in, which made programs much easier to write, read and maintain.
    

# Chapter 02: High Level Leap

- The next big step was the invention of high-level programming languages. FORTRAN,the first high level language, created in 1957, helped scientists write mathematical formulas directly. It introduced subroutines, loops, and compiler optimizations that dramatically boosted productivity while making programs portable between IBM 704 mainframes. The Fortran Code example shows how to add 2 integers together into a variable and print it.
    
- COBOL, created in 1959, has an English-like syntax that improved readability and revolutionized business applications. The COBOL code snippet has 2 variables,hours and rate,which are both top level variables and 3 digit numbers.Using those variables,it calculates the pay and displays it.
    
- ALGOL 60 introduced concepts that became the blueprint for most modern languages. Nested blocks and lexical scope influenced C, Pascal, and JavaScript. Recursive procedures enabled dynamic programming and tree traversal, and the BNF(Backus-Naur Form) notation provided a formal way to define language grammar still used today.
